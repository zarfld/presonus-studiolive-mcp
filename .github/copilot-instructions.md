## 🧭 Core Philosophy: "Slow is Fast" + "No Excuses" + "No Shortcuts" + "Clarify First"

### "Slow is Fast": Deliberate Development

> **If you go deliberately and carefully now, you'll go much faster overall.**

**In Development Process**:
- **Design before coding** → Fewer rewrites, less scope creep, easier maintenance
- **Tests & TDD** → Bugs caught early, changes safer/faster, confident shipping
- **Code reviews** → Better APIs, fewer defects, knowledge spread
- **Avoid premature optimization** → Cleaner code, real performance gains where it matters
- **Tooling & automation** → Every future change faster, safer, more repeatable

**In Runtime Behavior**:
- **Backpressure & throttling** → Systems stay stable, higher effective throughput
- **Correct concurrency** → Fewer race conditions, less debugging, safer scaling
- **Cache warm-up & gradual rollouts** → Predictable performance, smoother operation

**What It Does NOT Mean**:
❌ Endless architecture astronautics  
❌ Perfect design before any code  
❌ Never shipping because still "refining"  

**What It DOES Mean**:
✅ Purposeful pacing  
✅ Short feedback loops  
✅ Small, well-thought increments  

**Heuristic**: If "going slow" reduces rework, bugs, or instability later, it's the kind of "slow" that makes you fast.

---

### "No Excuses": Ownership and Robustness

> **If it's your code or your system, you own the outcome – not the tools, not the spec, not "the user", not the deadline.**

**Ownership of Behavior**:
- Library has a bug? → Sandbox it, add retries, or replace it
- API is weird? → Wrap it in a sane adapter
- Users misuse UI? → Improve UX, validation, confirmations
- Legacy code is messy? → Anti-corruption layers, gradual migration
- **Result**: Defensive coding, better abstractions, stable behavior

**Error Handling (Assume Things Go Wrong)**:
- Don't assume files exist → Check, handle failure, log clearly, degrade gracefully
- Don't assume network is fine → Timeouts, retries with backoff, circuit breakers
- Don't assume happy path → Test edge cases, document failure modes
- **Result**: Systems fail under control with good diagnostics

**Quality (No Shortcuts)**:
- "No time for tests" → Cover critical paths at minimum
- "We'll refactor later" → Leave code slightly better than you found it
- "Deadline pressure" → Avoid "just this once" shortcuts that become permanent
- **Result**: Fewer regressions, lower maintenance cost, less firefighting

**Communication (No Surprises)**:
- Dependency late? → Communicate early, propose options
- Scope unrealistic? → Say it explicitly, suggest trade-offs
- Made a mistake? → Admit quickly, focus on mitigation
- **Result**: Clear contracts, fewer shocks, trust in commitments

**What "No Excuses" Does NOT Mean**:
❌ Blaming individuals when things break  
❌ Ignoring systemic problems  
❌ Forcing overtime / heroics  
❌ Suffering silently without raising issues  

**What "No Excuses" DOES Mean**:
✅ Owning your part of the system  
✅ Being proactive instead of reactive  
✅ Turning problems into concrete actions (tests, refactors, monitoring)  
✅ Professionalism: don't argue with reality, don't hide behind tools  

**Heuristic**: Reasons explain problems; excuses avoid responsibility. Acknowledge constraints, then optimize within them.

### "No Shortcuts": Refusing to Trade Long-Term Health for Short-Term Gain

> **Don't sacrifice the system's long-term health for a tiny short-term win. Simplify and optimize, but never skip the essentials: correctness, clarity, tests, security.**

**Design & Architecture (No Shortcuts)**:
- One service/class now → "We'll refactor later" → Never happens; every change hurts
- Hardcoded values → "Configs are overkill" → Changes require code deploys
- No interfaces → "We'll define them later" → Tight coupling, risky refactors
- **No shortcuts**: Define minimal but clear boundaries; separate concerns even in small steps; avoid "temporary" hacks that become permanent
- **Result**: Even small designs are deliberate and leave room to evolve

**Tests & Correctness (No Shortcuts)**:
- "This is trivial, no test needed" → Hidden regressions, fear of change
- "Tests after the demo" → Never written; bugs discovered in production
- Copy/paste blocks → "What could go wrong?" → Multiple versions to maintain
- **No shortcuts**: Cover critical paths and edge cases; write tests when fixing bugs; prefer small testable units
- **Result**: Reliability costs time upfront, saves multiples later

**Error Handling & Resilience (No Shortcuts)**:
- Ignoring return codes → "It won't fail" → No idea what happened in production
- No timeouts/retries → Single point of failure cascades
- Missing or noisy logging → Cannot diagnose failures
- **No shortcuts**: Handle failures as normal cases; useful error messages with context; timeouts, retries, backoff, fallbacks
- **Result**: Small glitch self-heals vs. full-scale outage

**Security & Validation (No Shortcuts)**:
- "Internal only, no auth needed" → Internal services can be abused
- "Trust the client" → Injection attacks, data corruption
- Secrets in code → "Just for convenience" → Security incident
- **No shortcuts**: Validate and sanitize external input; treat internal services as potentially hostile; proper secret management, least privilege
- **Result**: Security shortcuts are cheap today, catastrophic tomorrow

**Performance & Optimization (No Shortcuts)**:
- Premature optimization → "We must be fast now" → Complex, unmaintainable code
- No measurement → "I think this is slow" → Optimizing wrong thing
- **No shortcuts**: First write simple, clear code; measure with profiler; optimize true hot spots; document why optimizations exist
- **Result**: Don't shortcut the measure → analyze → optimize cycle

**Documentation & Naming (No Shortcuts)**:
- No README/docs → "We know what it does" → Slow onboarding, forgotten context
- Cryptic names → Future you doesn't understand it
- No change log → Breaking changes surprise users
- **No shortcuts**: Name things clearly; document non-obvious invariants/assumptions; maintain minimal but current README/architecture notes
- **Result**: Leave future you and others a usable map

**Code Review & Collaboration (No Shortcuts)**:
- Merge without review → "It's urgent" → Quality erosion
- Giant PRs → Mixed concerns, impossible to review properly
- Ignore feedback → "It works, move on" → Trust erosion
- **No shortcuts**: Small changes reviewable properly; address feedback or explain reasoning; use reviews to improve code and shared understanding
- **Result**: Invest minutes now to avoid hours of confusion later

**Refactoring & Technical Debt (No Shortcuts)**:
- "Add another if" → "Clean later" → Snowballing complexity
- Duplicate logic → "Faster than extracting" → Multiple versions drift
- Leave broken abstractions → "Not my problem" → Every feature takes longer
- **No shortcuts**: Boy Scout rule (leave code better than found); pay back technical debt regularly; when touching fragile area, stabilize it (tests + refactor)
- **Result**: Prevent compound interest on technical debt

**What "No Shortcuts" Does NOT Mean**:
❌ Overengineering everything  
❌ Adding layers "just in case"  
❌ Blocking delivery until everything is "perfect"  
❌ Gold-plating features  

**What "No Shortcuts" DOES Mean**:
✅ Do the **essential** engineering work for the problem at hand  
✅ Don't knowingly skip things that will hurt you soon (tests, error handling, minimal design, basic docs)  
✅ Simplify by **reducing complexity**, not by ignoring necessary work  
✅ Distinguish between YAGNI (speculation) and needed work (correctness, maintainability)  

**Heuristic**: Am I avoiding work that makes the system safer, clearer, easier to change in the **near future**? If yes, that's probably a shortcut I shouldn't take.

**Key Distinction**:
- **YAGNI** (You Aren't Gonna Need It) → Don't build speculative features
- **No Shortcuts** → Don't skip essential engineering for current features

---

### "Clarify First – Never Code on Guesses"

> **Requirements are part of your job, not "somebody else's problem". Misinterpretations are defects, not excuses.**

**Essence**: Vague requirements = bugs waiting to happen. Clarifying requirements is engineering work, not overhead.

**In Requirements Engineering**:
- Vague requirement? → Surface it, don't ignore it
- Contradictory specs? → Don't pick one silently; escalate
- Unsure what user needs? → Don't guess; ask with concrete examples
- **Result**: Spend 30 minutes clarifying now vs. days reworking later

**Clarification Test** (Before Implementing Anything):
> If you cannot explain the requirement back in 2–3 sentences with clear examples, you don't understand it well enough to implement it.

**Treat Misinterpretations as Process Bugs**:
- Every mismatch between implemented vs. needed → Fix code + improve capture process
- Root causes:
  - Vague wording → Require concrete examples + acceptance criteria
  - Hidden assumptions → Make explicit, reference previous patterns
  - Spoken-only decisions → Must be logged before implementation
  - Ambiguous domain terms → Maintain glossary (ubiquitous language)
- **Result**: Don't blame people; harden system against misinterpretation

**What "Clarify First" Does NOT Mean**:
❌ Analysis paralysis / endless refinement  
❌ Refusing to start until 100% perfect spec  
❌ Treating stakeholders as adversaries  
❌ Ignoring emergent understanding  

**What "Clarify First" DOES Mean**:
✅ No implementation without written acceptance criteria  
✅ Restate requirements in your own words ("So what you want is...")  
✅ Look for edge cases upfront, not after implementation  
✅ Capture clarifications somewhere persistent (ticket, spec, comment)  
✅ Follow requirements – AND challenge them when they don't make sense  
✅ Respect the spec, but question inconsistencies, safety issues, incompleteness  

**Concrete Practices**:
- **Specification by Example**: Every requirement has Given-When-Then examples
- **Executable Specs**: Tests are living requirements; if tests fail, either code or spec is wrong
- **Frequent Demos**: Thin slices shown early reveal mental model mismatches
- **Traceability**: Every PR/commit references requirement; each requirement links to design/tests/code

**Heuristic**: If you're implementing based on assumptions rather than confirmed understanding, you're introducing technical debt disguised as progress.

**Reinforces**:
- "Slow is fast" (30 minutes clarifying now saves days of rework)
- "No excuses" (vague spec explains problem but doesn't absolve team from fixing process)
- "No shortcuts" (don't implement half-baked features just because text exists)

## Complementary Engineering Philosophies

These principles build upon and reinforce the three core philosophies:

### 1. "Make it work, make it right, make it fast"

**Sequence**: Correctness → Design → Optimization

**Application**:
- **Make it work**: First get a minimal vertical slice working end-to-end; prove feasibility
- **Make it right**: Clean up design, extract abstractions, add tests; remove duplication
- **Make it fast**: Only then profile and optimize hotspots; avoid premature optimizations

**Reinforces**: "Slow is fast" (deliberate sequence), "No shortcuts" (don't skip "make it right")

---

### 2. "Simplicity over cleverness"

**Essence**: Simple and boring beats clever and fragile

**Application**:
- Prefer straightforward algorithms and designs over "smart" tricks
- Choose standard patterns and libraries unless there is a clear reason not to
- If a solution is hard to explain in 2-3 minutes, it might be too clever

**Reinforces**: "No shortcuts" (maintainability), "Slow is fast" (simpler = fewer bugs)

---

### 3. "Small, incremental change"

**Essence**: Big-bang changes are fragile; small steps are safe and fast

**Application**:
- Small PRs/commits with a single clear purpose
- Refactor in slices instead of massive rewrites
- Deploy frequently with small deltas → simpler rollbacks and debugging

**Reinforces**: "Slow is fast" (fast feedback loops), XP Continuous Integration

---

### 4. "Explicit is better than implicit"

**Essence**: Make behavior and dependencies visible

**Application**:
- Clear function signatures instead of hidden globals
- Explicit configuration instead of "magic" defaults
- Clear types and contracts instead of relying on convention

**Reinforces**: "No excuses" (debuggability), "No shortcuts" (clarity over cleverness)

---

### 5. "Feedback is a first-class asset"

**Essence**: Treat every form of feedback as a primary tool, not a nuisance

**Application**:
- Tests, linters, logs, metrics, profilers = feedback loops
- User bug reports and complaints are input to improve robustness and UX
- Code reviews are a feedback mechanism, not a formality

**Reinforces**: "Slow is fast" (rapid feedback), "No shortcuts" (don't disable alarms)

---

### 6. "You build it, you run it"

**Essence**: Responsibility for code extends into production

**Application**:
- Developers involved in monitoring, alerting, and on-call (where appropriate)
- Design decisions consider operability: logs, metrics, traceability
- Don't throw code "over the fence" to ops/support

**Reinforces**: "No excuses" (ownership), "No shortcuts" (operational concerns upfront)

---

### 7. "If it hurts, do it more often (and automate)"

**Essence**: Painful tasks signal missing automation or process design

**Application**:
- If releases are painful, release more frequently and automate
- If merging is painful, integrate more often and refine branching strategy
- If testing is painful, improve test tools and testability

**Reinforces**: "Slow is fast" (invest in tooling), XP Continuous Integration

---

### 8. "Prefer boring technology for critical paths"

**Essence**: Stability and predictability beat novelty for core systems

**Application**:
- For critical infrastructure (drivers, timing, finance, production systems), prefer:
  - Well-known languages
  - Mature frameworks
  - Battle-tested libraries
- Use experimental or cutting-edge tech at the edges, not in the core

**Reinforces**: "No shortcuts" (don't buy "fast" development with unknown risks)

---

### 9. "Strong opinions, weakly held"

**Essence**: Be decisive, but change your mind when confronted with better evidence

**Application**:
- Have a default way to do things (coding style, architecture preferences)
- When data or convincing arguments show a better way, adapt quickly
- Avoid dogmatism ("we *always* do X") in favor of reasoned standards

**Reinforces**: XP values (courage to change, feedback-driven), "Slow is fast" (learning)

---

### 10. "Leave the campsite cleaner than you found it" (Boy Scout Rule)

**Essence**: Always make the codebase slightly better as you touch it

**Application**:
- When you work in a file:
  - Fix a small smell
  - Update a misleading comment
  - Add or improve a test
- Don't wait for a "big refactor" that may never be scheduled

**Reinforces**: "No shortcuts" (incremental improvement), prevents technical debt compound interest

---

### 11. "Reuse before reinvent" + "One source of truth" + "Curate, don't accumulate"

**Essence**: Prefer existing solutions, eliminate duplication, keep codebase clean

**11a. Reuse Before Reinvent**:
- Before writing new code, check if codebase or mature libraries already have it
- Wrap or extend existing components instead of forking casually
- Align with standard implementations and idioms
- **Result**: Less code, fewer bugs, less maintenance; more time for domain problems

**11b. One Source of Truth** (No Redundant Implementations):
- Each concept has single authoritative implementation or definition
- Shared constants/types instead of duplicated literals (enums, error codes, register definitions)
- Centralized business rules (one module, used everywhere)
- When duplicated logic found → Extract to shared function/module, replace all copies
- **Result**: Rule changes in one place; compiler/tests propagate

**11c. Curate, Don't Accumulate** (Keep Repo Clean):
- Repository is curated product, not dumping ground
- Dead code is removed, not commented out
- Obsolete paths deprecated then deleted
- Experiments either graduate to structured location (`experiments/`) or are archived
- Regular cleanup: Remove unused functions/files, consolidate helpers, delete old experiments
- **Result**: Clear structure, no `old/`, `backup/`, `tmp/` folders; no `xyz_old.c`, `xyz_new.c`, `xyz_refactor.c`

**Trade-offs and Guardrails**:
- Third-party dependencies: Check licensing, maintenance, quality, API stability
- Don't pull huge framework for tiny feature
- Internal reuse: Don't force-fit where requirements truly differ
- If generalizing, keep API simple; avoid over-generalizing

**Reinforces**: 
- "No shortcuts" (eliminate duplication properly, don't leave tech debt)
- "Boy Scout rule" (cleanup as you go)
- "Simplicity over cleverness" (one clear solution beats many fragmented ones)

## 🔗 Traceability Workflow (GitHub Issues)

### All Work Must Start with an Issue

Before any implementation, design, or testing work:
1. Navigate to **Issues → New Issue**
2. Select appropriate template:
   - **Stakeholder Requirement (StR)** - Business needs and context
   - **Functional Requirement (REQ-F)** - System functional behavior
   - **Non-Functional Requirement (REQ-NF)** - Quality attributes (performance, security, etc.)
   - **Architecture Decision (ADR)** - Architectural choices and rationale
   - **Architecture Component (ARC-C)** - Component specifications
   - **Quality Scenario (QA-SC)** - ATAM quality attribute scenarios
   - **Test Case (TEST)** - Verification and validation specifications
3. Complete **ALL required fields** (marked with red asterisk)
4. Link to parent issues using `#N` syntax
5. Submit → GitHub auto-assigns unique issue number
6. **Update status when starting work** - See [GitHub Issue Workflow](../docs/github-issue-workflow.md) for status management

### Issue Linking Rules (Bidirectional Traceability)

#### ⚠️ EXACT SYNTAX REQUIRED (CI Validation)

**CI validates traceability links using strict regex patterns. Use EXACT syntax below:**

**Parent Link Syntax** (REQUIRED for all non-StR issues):
```markdown
## Traceability
- Traces to:  #123 (parent StR issue)
```

**Regex Pattern (CI)**: `/[Tt]races?\s+to:?\s*#(\d+)/`

**Accepted Variations** (case-insensitive, flexible spacing):
- ✅ `- Traces to: #123` (preferred)
- ✅ `Traces to #123`
- ✅ `Trace to: #123`

**Common MISTAKES (will FAIL CI)**:
- ❌ `Links to: #123` (wrong verb)
- ❌ `Traced to: #123` (wrong tense)
- ❌ `- **Trace to**: #123` (bullets & bolding incorrect)
- ❌ `**Traces to**: #123` (bolding incorrect)
- ❌ `Parent: #123` (missing "Traces to")
- ❌ `Implements: #123` (wrong relationship type)
- ❌ Missing `#` before number
- ❌ Missing issue number entirely

**Test Verification Syntax** (REQUIRED for TEST issues):
```markdown
## Traceability
- Verifies: #45 (requirement being tested)
```

**Regex Pattern (CI)**: `/[Vv]erif(?:ies|ied\s+[Rr]equirements?):?\s*#(\d+)/g`

**Accepted Variations**:
- ✅ `- Verifies: #45, #67` (multiple requirements)
- ✅ `- Verified Requirements: #45`

**Common MISTAKES (will FAIL CI)**:
- ❌ `Tests: #45` (wrong verb)
- ❌ `Validates: #45` (wrong verb)
- ❌ `Covers: #45` (wrong verb)
- ❌ `- **Verifies**: #45` (bolding incorrect)
- ❌ `**Verifies**: #45` (bolding incorrect)

---

**Upward Traceability** (Child → Parent):
```markdown
## Traceability
- Traces to:  #123 (parent StR issue)
- Depends on: #45, #67 (prerequisite requirements)
```

**Downward Traceability** (Parent → Children):
```markdown
## Traceability
- Verified by: #89, #90 (test issues)
- Implemented by: #PR-15 (pull request)
- Refined by: #234, #235 (child requirements)
```

**Required Links**:
- REQ-F/REQ-NF **MUST** trace to parent StR issue using `Traces to: #N`
- ADR **MUST** link to requirements it satisfies using `Traces to: #N`
- ARC-C **MUST** link to ADRs and requirements using `Traces to: #N`
- TEST **MUST** link to requirements being verified using `Verifies: #N`
- All PRs **MUST** link to implementing issue(s) using `Fixes #N` or `Implements #N`
- StR (Stakeholder Requirements) are EXEMPT from parent link requirement (they are root-level)

### Issue Reference Syntax

In issue bodies, PR descriptions, and code comments:
```markdown
# Link to specific issue
#123

# Close issue from PR
Fixes #123
Closes #124
Resolves #125

# Reference without closing
Implements #126
Part of #127
Relates to #128

# Multiple issues
Fixes #123, #124, #125
```

### Pull Request Workflow

**Every PR MUST**:
1. Link to implementing issue using `Fixes #N` or `Implements #N` in description
2. Reference issue number in commit messages
3. Pass all CI checks including traceability validation
4. Have at least one approved review

**PR Template** (create `.github/pull_request_template.md`):

### When Generating Code

**Always include issue references in code**:

```python
"""
User authentication module.

Implements: #123 (REQ-F-AUTH-001: User Login)
Architecture: #45 (ADR-SECU-001: JWT Authentication)
Verified by: #89 (TEST-AUTH-LOGIN-001)

See: https://github.com/zarfld/copilot-instructions-template/issues/123
"""
class AuthenticationService:
    pass
```

```typescript
/**
 * User login endpoint
 * 
 * @implements #123 REQ-F-AUTH-001: User Login
 * @see https://github.com/zarfld/copilot-instructions-template/issues/123
 */
export async function loginUser(credentials: Credentials): Promise<User> {
  // Implementation
}
```

### When Creating Tests

**Link tests to verified requirements**:

```python
"""
Test user login functionality.

Verifies: #123 (REQ-F-AUTH-001: User Login)
Test Type: Integration
Priority: P0 (Critical)

Acceptance Criteria (from #123):
  Given user has valid credentials
  When user submits login form
  Then user is authenticated and redirected to dashboard
"""
def test_user_login_success():
    # Test implementation
```

```typescript
describe('User Login (Verifies #123)', () => {
  /**
   * Verifies: REQ-F-AUTH-001 (Issue #123)
   * Acceptance Criteria: User can log in with valid credentials
   */
  it('should authenticate user with valid credentials', () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
});
```

### When Documenting Architecture

**ADRs must reference requirements**:

```markdown
# ADR-SECU-001: Use JWT for Authentication

**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2025-11-12
**Issue**: #45

## Context
Requirement #123 (REQ-F-AUTH-001) requires secure user authentication.

## Decision
We will use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for stateless authentication.

## Consequences
### Positive
- Stateless authentication
- Scalable across services

### Requirements Satisfied
- #123 (REQ-F-AUTH-001: User Login)
- #124 (REQ-NF-SECU-002: Session Security)
```

## 🎨 General Guidelines

### When User Provides Requirements

1. **Create Issue First** - Before any work:
   - Use appropriate issue template
   - Complete all required fields
   - Link to parent issues
   - Get issue number assigned

2. **Clarify Ambiguities** - Ask questions about:
   - Unclear functional requirements
   - Missing non-functional requirements (performance, security, usability)
   - Stakeholder priorities and constraints
   - Acceptance criteria
   - Technical constraints
   - Parent issue relationships

3. **Apply Appropriate Phase** - Identify which lifecycle phase the work belongs to

4. **Use Phase-Specific Instructions** - Phase-specific guidance is auto-applied based on file location via `.github/instructions/phase-NN-*.instructions.md`

5. **Maintain Traceability** - Every artifact links to GitHub issues:
   ```
   StR Issue (#1) → REQ-F Issue (#2) → ADR Issue (#4) → Code (PR #10) → TEST Issue (#7)
   ```

### When Writing Code

1. **Test-First (TDD)**:
   ```
   Red → Write failing test
   Green → Write minimal code to pass
   Refactor → Improve design while keeping tests green
   ```

2. **Simple Design Principles**:
   - Pass all tests
   - Reveal intention clearly
   - No duplication (DRY)
   - Minimal classes and methods

3. **Continuous Integration**:
   - Integrate frequently (multiple times per day)
   - Run all tests before integration
   - Fix broken builds immediately

### When Reviewing/Analyzing Code

1. Check compliance with:
   - Design specifications (IEEE 1016)
   - Coding standards
   - Test coverage (target >80%)
   - Documentation completeness

2. Verify traceability:
   - Tests cover requirements
   - Code implements design
   - Documentation is current

### Documentation Standards

All documentation must follow:
- **IEEE 1016-2009** format for design documents
- **IEEE 42010:2011** format for architecture documents
- **ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2018** format for requirements
- **Markdown** format for specs (Spec-Kit compatible)

## 🚨 Critical Rules

### Always Do (Embrace "Slow is Fast" + "No Excuses" + "No Shortcuts" + "Clarify First")
✅ Ask clarifying questions when requirements are unclear (go slow: understand first; no excuses: communication over assumptions; no shortcuts: clarity over speed; clarify first: vague requirements are bugs; explicit over implicit)  
✅ Write tests BEFORE implementation (TDD) - absolute rule, no exceptions (go slow: define behavior, save debugging time; no excuses: quality is your responsibility; no shortcuts: cover critical paths; make it work, make it right, make it fast)  
✅ Handle errors defensively (no excuses: check files exist, handle network failures, validate inputs; no shortcuts: handle failures as normal cases; explicit over implicit)  
✅ Wrap unstable dependencies (no excuses: library bugs are your problem to isolate; no shortcuts: sandboxing prevents cascading failures)  
✅ Communicate blockers early (no excuses: surprises are failures; propose options, not just problems; no shortcuts: transparency over comfortable silence; feedback as asset)  
✅ Challenge and prove every assumption with tests or experiments (go slow: validate now, avoid rework; no excuses: proof over speculation)  
✅ Use spike solutions for technical unknowns (time-boxed learning) (go slow: learn deliberately)  
✅ Maintain requirements traceability via GitHub Issues (go slow: track now, trace easily later; no excuses: ownership of scope; no shortcuts: essential for compliance)  
✅ Follow the phase-specific copilot instructions (go slow: follow process, avoid chaos; no shortcuts: deliberate process over ad-hoc)  
✅ Document architecture decisions (ADRs) with empirical justification (go slow: write rationale, faster onboarding; no shortcuts: document non-obvious invariants; explicit over implicit)  
✅ Include acceptance criteria in user stories (go slow: define done, avoid scope creep; no shortcuts: measurable criteria over vague goals; clarify first: concrete examples prevent misinterpretation; explicit over implicit)  
✅ Restate requirements in your own words before implementing (clarify first: 2-3 sentences with examples; if can't explain it, don't understand it; feedback as asset)  
✅ Capture clarifications in persistent artifacts (clarify first: ticket comments, spec updates, ADR notes; spoken decisions must be logged)  
✅ Look for edge cases upfront, not after implementation (clarify first: vague specs hide edge cases; go slow: discover now vs. debug later)  
✅ Challenge requirements when they don't make sense (clarify first: respect spec but question inconsistencies; no excuses: don't hide behind vague text)  
✅ Run all tests before committing code (go slow: catch bugs early, cheaper fixes; no excuses: your code, your stability; no shortcuts: reliability costs upfront; feedback as asset)  
✅ Fix CI breaks immediately (<10 minutes) (go slow: stop bleeding, prevent infection; no excuses: your break, your fix)  
✅ Update documentation when code changes (go slow: maintain clarity, reduce confusion; no shortcuts: current docs over outdated maps; explicit over implicit)  
✅ Keep Red-Green-Refactor cycle under 10 minutes (go slow: small steps, rapid feedback)  
✅ State temporal requirements in measurable terms (for real-time systems) (go slow: be precise upfront)  
✅ Keep ISRs terse and efficient (<5µs hard, <50µs soft real-time) (go slow: design carefully)  
✅ Measure timing empirically (GPIO + oscilloscope) before claiming compliance (go slow: prove it; no excuses: claims need data)  
✅ Listen to instincts (fear, "walking uphill" = design problem) (go slow: trust your gut; no excuses: face design issues)  
✅ Seek feedback in minutes/hours (not weeks) (go slow: rapid cycles beat big batches; feedback as asset)  
✅ Report bad news immediately (max reaction time for stakeholders) (go slow: courage now, trust later; no excuses: own failures early; no shortcuts: transparency prevents crises)  
✅ Provide options (not excuses) when reporting problems (go slow: think through solutions; no excuses: propose, don't deflect)  
✅ Separate estimates from promises (promise truth, not dates) (go slow: honest communication)  
✅ Make status visible (15-second glance = Big Visible Charts) (go slow: transparency builds trust)  
✅ Celebrate changing your mind when facts change (go slow: learning over ego; strong opinions weakly held)  
✅ Use Five Whys to find root causes (often people problems) (go slow: deep analysis)  
✅ Focus on team problems (not individual blame) (go slow: systemic solutions; no excuses: own your part, not others')  
✅ Leave code better than you found it (no excuses: incremental improvement over "refactor later"; no shortcuts: Boy Scout rule; campsite cleaner)  
✅ Check for existing solutions before writing new code (reuse before reinvent; one source of truth; no shortcuts: less code = fewer bugs)  
✅ Extract duplicated logic to shared functions (one source of truth; no shortcuts: single authoritative implementation)  
✅ Remove dead code and obsolete paths (curate don't accumulate; campsite cleaner; no shortcuts: clean repo over dumping ground)  
✅ Report mistakes immediately and focus on mitigation (no excuses: admit quickly, fix fast; no shortcuts: transparency prevents worse crises; feedback as asset)  
✅ Define minimal but clear boundaries (no shortcuts: separate concerns even in small steps; avoid temporary hacks; explicit over implicit)  
✅ Write small testable units (no shortcuts: prefer testable over giant functions you're afraid to touch; simplicity over cleverness; small incremental change)  
✅ Use timeouts, retries, and fallbacks (no shortcuts: resilience patterns prevent outages)  
✅ Validate and sanitize all external input (no shortcuts: security is essential, not optional; explicit over implicit)  
✅ Measure before optimizing (no shortcuts: profiler data over hunches; make it work, make it right, make it fast)  
✅ Name things clearly (no shortcuts: readability for future you; explicit over implicit; simplicity over cleverness)  
✅ Keep PRs small and reviewable (no shortcuts: minutes now to avoid hours of confusion later; small incremental change)  
✅ Address code review feedback (no shortcuts: use reviews to improve shared understanding; feedback as asset; strong opinions weakly held)  
✅ Automate painful processes (if it hurts, do it more often and automate; go slow: invest in tooling)  
✅ Use boring technology for critical paths (prefer boring tech; no shortcuts: stability over novelty for core systems)  
✅ Design for operability (you build it, you run it; no excuses: operational concerns upfront)    

### Never Do (False Speed = Real Slowness; Excuses = Avoided Responsibility; Shortcuts = Long-Term Pain; Guesses = Hidden Bugs)
❌ Proceed with ambiguous requirements (rushing = massive rework later; clarify first: vague requirements are defects; implicit assumptions = chaos)  
❌ Assume files exist / network is fine / inputs are valid (no excuses: check and handle failures; no shortcuts: handle as normal cases; explicit validation)  
❌ Blame tools when behavior fails (no excuses: wrap it, retry it, replace it; you build it, you run it)  
❌ Say "users are stupid" (no excuses: improve UX, validation, error messages; feedback as asset)  
❌ Use "no time for tests" as excuse (no excuses: at minimum, cover critical paths; no shortcuts: reliability costs upfront; make it work, make it right, make it fast)  
❌ Promise "we'll refactor later" without doing it (no excuses: incremental improvement now; no shortcuts: Boy Scout rule; campsite cleaner)  
❌ Hide problems until they explode (no excuses: communicate early, propose options; no shortcuts: transparency over comfort; feedback as asset)  
❌ Start implementation without creating/linking GitHub issue (no tracking = lost context; no shortcuts: deliberate boundaries; small incremental change)  
❌ Write code without tests (fast now = debugging hell later; no shortcuts: cover critical paths)  
❌ Write code BEFORE writing a failing test (TDD violation) (skipping red = unclear requirements)  
❌ Assume code works without proof ("I'm pretty sure this will work") (assumptions = production fires)  
❌ Build speculative features ("We might need this later") (YAGNI violation = wasted effort)  
❌ Copy-paste code without understanding and testing (fast copy = slow maintenance)  
❌ Reinvent existing solutions without checking codebase or libraries (reuse before reinvent; wasted effort on solved problems)  
❌ Leave duplicated logic in multiple places (one source of truth; maintenance nightmare when rules change)  
❌ Keep dead code or commented-out blocks (curate don't accumulate; cluttered codebase hides intent)  
❌ Create 'UtilityX2', 'NewFoo', 'Foo_v2_final' variants (curate don't accumulate; fragmentation over consolidation)  
❌ Implement based on assumptions rather than confirmed understanding (clarify first: assumptions are technical debt disguised as progress)  
❌ Ignore contradictory specs hoping they'll resolve themselves (clarify first: don't pick one silently, escalate conflicts)  
❌ Trust documentation without empirical verification (docs lie, code runs)  
❌ Start implementation without concrete examples (clarify first: Given-When-Then prevents misinterpretation)  
❌ Accept "as usual" or "like last time" without explicit reference (clarify first: hidden assumptions cause mismatches)  
❌ Create PR without `Fixes #N` or `Implements #N` link (broken traceability = compliance failures; explicit over implicit)  
❌ Write tests without linking to requirement issue (orphaned tests = wasted effort; explicit over implicit)  
❌ Make architecture decisions without ADR issue (undocumented = repeated debates; no shortcuts: document rationale; explicit over implicit)  
❌ Skip documentation updates (outdated docs = onboarding nightmare; no shortcuts: maintain current map; explicit over implicit)  
❌ Ignore standards compliance (shortcuts = audit failures)  
❌ Break existing tests (ignoring red = cascading bugs; feedback as asset)  
❌ Commit untested code ("works on my machine" = production fires)  
❌ Let CI stay broken for >10 minutes (broken builds = compounding delays)  
❌ Create circular dependencies (tight coupling = maintenance hell; no shortcuts: clear boundaries; simplicity over cleverness)  
❌ Ignore security considerations (fast insecure = breach later; no shortcuts: security is essential)  
❌ Create orphaned requirements (no parent/child links = unvalidated work)  
❌ Put complex logic in ISRs (real-time systems) (fast ISR = system instability)  
❌ Use blocking calls in time-critical code (blocking = deadline misses)  
❌ Use unbounded iterations in hard real-time code (unbounded = unpredictable)  
❌ Claim timing guarantees without measurement proof (claims without data = fiction)  
❌ Ignore negative emotions (fear = cue something is wrong) (ignoring gut = disaster)  
❌ Report "90% done" without working software (fiction = lost trust)  
❌ Hide bad news or delay reporting problems (hiding = worse crisis later)  
❌ Promise deadlines (only estimate and promise truth) (false promises = broken trust)  
❌ Blame individuals when things break (no excuses: focus on systemic fixes, not scapegoats)  
❌ Report progress without objective data (tests, velocity) (subjective = fantasy)  
❌ Merge without code review (no shortcuts: quality erosion from urgency; feedback as asset)  
❌ Ignore return codes or exceptions (no shortcuts: small glitch vs. outage; explicit over implicit)  
❌ Skip input validation (no shortcuts: security is essential; explicit over implicit)  
❌ Use cryptic names (no shortcuts: readability for future you; explicit over implicit; simplicity over cleverness)  
❌ Premature optimization without measurement (no shortcuts: measure → analyze → optimize; make it work, make it right, make it fast)  
❌ Giant PRs with mixed concerns (no shortcuts: reviewable changes save time; small incremental change)  
❌ Use experimental tech for critical paths (prefer boring technology; no shortcuts: stability for core systems)  
❌ Ignore painful processes (if it hurts, automate it; go slow: invest in tooling)  
❌ Refuse to change mind when evidence contradicts (strong opinions weakly held; feedback as asset)  
❌ Say "It works on my machine" (working = deployed + tested) (local success = production failure)  
❌ Work under a lie (if behind, adjust plan immediately)  
❌ Say "It works on my machine" (working = deployed + tested) (local success = production failure)  
❌ Work under a lie (if behind, adjust plan immediately)

## 🔍 When to Ask Questions

Ask the user to clarify when:

1. **Requirements are vague** - "Should this feature support multiple users?"
2. **Non-functional requirements missing** - "What are the performance requirements?"
3. **Design alternatives exist** - "Would you prefer approach A or B because...?"
4. **Security implications** - "Should this data be encrypted?"
5. **Scope unclear** - "Should this feature include X or is that out of scope?"
6. **Acceptance criteria undefined** - "How will we know this feature is complete?"
7. **Technical constraints unknown** - "Are there any platform or technology constraints?"
8. **Priority unclear** - "Is this a must-have or nice-to-have feature?"

### Question Format

Use structured questions:
```markdown
## Clarification Needed

**Context**: [Explain what you're trying to implement]

**Questions**:
1. [Specific question about functional requirement]
2. [Question about non-functional requirement]
3. [Question about acceptance criteria]

**Impact**: [Explain why these answers matter]
```

## 📚 Issue-Driven Development

Use GitHub Issues as the source of truth for requirements, architecture, and tests:

1. **Stakeholder Requirement (StR) Issue** → Drives system requirements
2. **Functional/Non-Functional Requirement (REQ-F/REQ-NF) Issues** → Generate test cases
3. **Architecture Decision (ADR) Issues** → Drive design decisions
4. **Architecture Component (ARC-C) Issues** → Generate code structure
5. **Test Case (TEST) Issues** → Generate test implementations

### Workflow

```markdown
1. Create StR issue for business need (#1)
2. Create REQ-F issues linked to StR (#2, #3)
3. Create ADR and ARC-C issues for architecture (#5, #6)
4. Implement with TDD (PR links to issues)
5. Create TEST issues to verify requirements (#10, #11)
6. Close issues when verified and deployed
```

**All artifacts reference GitHub Issues using `#N` syntax for bidirectional traceability.**
