```

## Best Practices

### 1. **Continuous Compliance**

Don't wait until the end to check compliance. Check continuously:

```markdown
- **Daily**: Run automated compliance checks in CI/CD
- **Weekly**: Review compliance dashboard
- **Sprint End**: Comprehensive compliance audit
- **Release**: Full standards certification audit
```

### 2. **Automate What You Can**

```yaml
# .github/workflows/standards-compliance.yml
- name: Check Standards Compliance
  run: |
    npm run standards:validate
    # Fails if compliance <95%
```

### 3. **Standards Training**

Ensure team knows the standards:

```markdown
## Required Team Training

- [ ] ISO 12207 Overview (1 hour)
- [ ] ISO 29148 Requirements Engineering (2 hours)
- [ ] IEEE 1016 Software Design (1.5 hours)
- [ ] IEEE 42010 Architecture (1.5 hours)
- [ ] IEEE 1012 V&V (2 hours)

**Total**: 8 hours of standards training
```

## Usage

1. Open project workspace
2. Open Copilot Chat
3. Type: `/standards-validate.prompt.md`
4. Review comprehensive compliance report
5. Fix critical issues first
6. Re-run validation until ≥95% compliant
7. Generate certification documentation

---

**Remember**: Standards compliance is not optional. It's the foundation of professional software engineering! 📜✅
