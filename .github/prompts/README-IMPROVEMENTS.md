# Requirements Prompts Improvements

**Date**: November 6, 2025  
**Issue**: Copilot not consistently delivering expected outputs when executing requirements prompts  
**Solution**: Added explicit "Expected Output" sections with complete templates

---

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### Problems Identified

1. **No Clear Output Format at Top**
   - Deliverable templates were buried deep in the prompt
   - Copilot had to read extensive guidance before understanding what to produce
   - Result: Sometimes stopped after questions, didn't generate final output

2. **Unclear Workflow**
   - Missing "START HERE → DO THIS → DELIVER THAT" structure
   - No explicit steps showing what to do when
   - Result: Copilot unclear about sequence of actions

3. **Example-Heavy Content**
   - Many examples but unclear which was the actual deliverable
   - Guidance overwhelmed the task definition
   - Result: Copilot focused on examples rather than producing output

4. **Missing Explicit Instructions**
   - No "ALWAYS DELIVER" or "MUST PRODUCE" language
   - Lacked emphasis on completing the full deliverable
   - Result: Partial outputs or summaries instead of complete documents

---

## ✅ Solutions Implemented

### 1. Added "📤 EXPECTED OUTPUT" Section

**Location**: Immediately after the agent role definition (lines 10-80 typically)

**Format**:
```markdown
## 📤 EXPECTED OUTPUT (ALWAYS DELIVER)

When [trigger condition], you **MUST** produce:

[Complete template showing exactly what to generate]
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Copilot sees expected output format first
- ✅ Clear template to follow
- ✅ No ambiguity about deliverables

### 2. Added "🎯 Your Task" Section

**Location**: After expected output, before detailed guidance

**Format**:
```markdown
## 🎯 Your Task

When [condition], you will:

**STEP 1**: [Action with reference to output]
**STEP 2**: [Action]
**STEP 3**: [Action]
**STEP 4**: Generate complete [deliverable] (see Expected Output above)

**Always deliver [output type]!** Do not skip or summarize.
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Clear step-by-step workflow
- ✅ References back to expected output
- ✅ Explicit instruction to complete full deliverable

### 3. Restructured Prompt Flow

**New Structure**:
```
1. YAML front matter
2. Role definition
3. 📤 EXPECTED OUTPUT (with complete template)
4. 🎯 Your Task (step-by-step workflow)
5. Detailed guidance (reference material)
```

**Old Structure**:
```
1. YAML front matter
2. Role definition
3. Objectives
4. Detailed guidance
5. Examples
6. Usage (deliverable buried here)
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Critical information first
- ✅ Reference material last (for context)
- ✅ Copilot knows what to produce before reading examples

## 🚀 Usage Guidelines

### For Users

**Before executing a prompt**:
1. Read the "📤 EXPECTED OUTPUT" section
2. Know what you'll receive
3. Prepare any inputs needed (files, requirement text, etc.)

**During execution**:
1. Copilot will follow the "🎯 Your Task" steps
2. Wait for complete output (may take time for large reports)
3. Don't interrupt early - let it complete all sections

**After receiving output**:
1. Verify all sections present (check against template)
2. If incomplete, ask: "Please complete all sections from the Expected Output template"
3. Use the output as-is or customize for your needs

### For Prompt Authors

**When creating new prompts**:
1. ✅ Start with "📤 EXPECTED OUTPUT" section showing complete template
2. ✅ Add "🎯 Your Task" with explicit steps
3. ✅ Use "**MUST**", "**ALWAYS DELIVER**", "Do not skip" language
4. ✅ Reference expected output in task steps ("see Expected Output above")
5. ✅ Put detailed guidance AFTER expected output
6. ✅ Test prompt to ensure full deliverable is generated

## 💡 Tips for Best Results

1. **Be Specific in Your Request**
   ```
   ❌ "Check requirements"
   ✅ "Run completeness check on REQ-F-001 through REQ-F-010"
   ```

2. **Reference Files Explicitly**
   ```
   ❌ "Validate requirements"
   ✅ "Validate requirements in ./02-requirements/functional/auth.md"
   ```

3. **Wait for Complete Output**
   - Copilot may take 30-60 seconds for full reports
   - Don't interrupt early
   - If output stops, ask: "Please complete the remaining sections"

4. **Provide Context When Needed**
   ```
   For elicitation:
   "Elicit requirements for [feature] targeting [audience] with [constraints]"
   
   For validation:
   "Validate against ISO 29148:2018 for [compliance level]"
   ```
