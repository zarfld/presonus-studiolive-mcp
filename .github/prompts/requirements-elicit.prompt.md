## 🔄 Elicitation Workflow

### Step 1: Initial Feature Description
User provides high-level feature description.

### Step 2: Ask Clarifying Questions
Generate questions document covering all 8 dimensions. Wait for stakeholder responses.

### Step 3: Determine Requirement Type(s)

Based on responses, determine what types of issues to create:

| If requirement is... | Create issue type... | Example |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------|
| High-level business need | **StR** (Stakeholder Requirement) | "Need to manage customer orders" |
| Specific system function | **REQ-F** (Functional Requirement) | "System shall validate email format" |
| Quality attribute | **REQ-NF** (Non-Functional Requirement) | "System shall respond in <200ms" |

**Note**: One StR often generates multiple REQ-F and REQ-NF issues.

### Step 4: Generate Issue Body(ies)

For each requirement type, generate complete issue body using the appropriate template above.

### Step 5: Establish Traceability

**Link issues together**:
- REQ-F/REQ-NF issues must link to parent StR: `Traces to:  #N`
- Related requirements link: `**Depends on**: #X, #Y`
- Tests link back: `**Verified by**: #Z` (created later)

### Step 6: Provide Creation Instructions

After generating issue bodies, tell user:

```markdown
## Next Steps: Create GitHub Issues

### 1. Create Stakeholder Requirement Issue
Navigate to: **Issues → New Issue → Stakeholder Requirement (StR)**

Copy the following body into the issue:
[Paste generated StR body]

**Submit** → GitHub will assign issue number (e.g., #1)

### 2. Create Functional Requirement Issue(s)
Navigate to: **Issues → New Issue → Functional Requirement (REQ-F)**

Copy the following body:
[Paste generated REQ-F body]

**Important**: Update `Traces to:  #1` with actual StR issue number from step 1.

**Submit** → GitHub will assign issue number (e.g., #10)

### 3. Create Non-Functional Requirement Issue(s)
[Repeat similar instructions for REQ-NF issues]

### 4. Update Parent Issue
Go back to StR issue #1 and add comment:
```markdown
## Child Requirements Created
- Functional: #10, #11, #12
- Non-Functional: #15, #16
```
```

---

## 📋 Elicitation Best Practices

### 1. Start with Stakeholder Requirements (StR)

Always start with high-level business context before diving into technical details.

### 2. One Issue Per Requirement

Don't combine multiple requirements in one issue. Keep issues focused and atomic.

### 3. Use Consistent Naming

- **StR**: `StR-[CATEGORY]-[NNN]` (e.g., StR-USER-001)
- **REQ-F**: `REQ-F-[CATEGORY]-[NNN]` (e.g., REQ-F-AUTH-001)
- **REQ-NF**: `REQ-NF-[CATEGORY]-[NNN]` (e.g., REQ-NF-PERF-001)

### 4. Ask Follow-Up Questions

If stakeholder responses are vague or incomplete, ask targeted follow-up questions.

### 5. Include Examples

Always include concrete examples in acceptance criteria (Gherkin scenarios).

### 6. Make NFRs Measurable

Non-functional requirements must have specific metrics and thresholds.

### 7. Establish Traceability Early

Link child requirements to parent StR immediately using `#N` syntax.
