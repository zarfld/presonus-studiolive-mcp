## Phase 04: Detailed Design - Standards-Compliant Transition

> **GitHub Issues Workflow**: Update architecture component issues (ARC-C) with detailed design specifications. Add design comments to architecture issues or create supplementary design documentation that references issues. Maintain traceability via issue references: #REQ → #ARC-C → code implementation → #TEST.
> 
> **Design Documentation**: You may create supplementary design markdown files in `04-design/components/`, but they MUST reference the canonical GitHub Issues using `#N` syntax:
> ```markdown
> # Component Design: User Authentication
> 
> **Architecture Issue**: #45 (ARC-C-AUTH-001: Authentication Service)
> **Requirements**: #23 (REQ-F-AUTH-001), #24 (REQ-NF-SECU-002)
> 
> ## Component Structure
> [Detailed design content here...]

**Context**: I have completed Phase 03 (Architecture Design) following ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2011 standards and am ready to transition to Phase 04 (Detailed Design) following IEEE 1016-2009 standards.

**Completed Architecture Artifacts**:
- Architecture specification with multiple viewpoints (Context, Logical, Deployment)
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) documenting key decisions
- All ADRs have rationale and link to requirements
- Quality attribute scenarios (Performance, Availability, Security)
- Architecture evaluation completed
- All architecture components identified with ARC-C-* IDs
- Traceability matrix linking requirements (REQ-*) to architecture components (ARC-C-*) and ADRs


**Phase 04 Objectives** (per IEEE 1016-2009):
1. Transform architecture components into detailed component designs
2. Specify interfaces, data structures, and algorithms
3. Create component-level design descriptions
4. Maintain traceability: ARC-C-* → DES-C-* → implementation units
5. Apply XP Simple Design principles (YAGNI, minimal complexity)

**Standards to Apply**:
- **IEEE 1016-2009**: Software Design Descriptions format
- **ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017**: Design Definition process
- **XP Practices**: Simple Design, Refactoring readiness, Test-first design

**Specific Request** (enforce traceability & unique IDs):
Please guide me through Phase 04 detailed design activities:
1. Review my architecture artifacts for design readiness
2. Help create component design specifications using IEEE 1016 format
3. Define interfaces and data models with proper traceability
4. Prepare test-driven design approach for Phase 05 implementation
5. Ensure design decisions support XP practices (especially TDD and refactoring)

**Questions for Clarification** (Answer before generating design specs):
- Should I prioritize certain architecture components for detailed design first?
- Are there specific performance or complexity constraints I should consider?
- What level of design detail is appropriate for the implementation approach planned?
