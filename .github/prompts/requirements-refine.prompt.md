## 🔨 Decomposition Recommendations

**This issue is too complex. Suggest creating [N] sub-issues:**

### Proposed Sub-Issue #1: [Title]

**Issue Type**: REQ-F / REQ-NF
**Labels**: `type:requirement:functional`, `phase:02-requirements`, `priority:high`, `child-of:#[parent]`

**Issue Body**:
```markdown
## Requirement Statement
[Specific, focused requirement extracted from parent]

## Rationale
[Why this is needed - reference parent issue]

## Acceptance Criteria
**Scenario**: [Focused scenario]
  **Given** [context]
  **When** [action]
  **Then** [specific outcome]

## Traceability
- Traces to:  #[parent-issue-number]
- **Depends on**: [if applicable]

## Notes
This is a decomposition of #[parent-issue]. See also #[sibling1], #[sibling2].
```

### Proposed Sub-Issue #2: [Title]
[Repeat structure]

**Action**: 
1. Create [N] new issues with content above
2. Update parent issue #[N] with links to children:
   ```markdown
   ## Decomposition
   This high-level requirement is implemented via:
   - #[child1]: [Title]
   - #[child2]: [Title]
   ```

---

## 🔗 Traceability Improvements

### Missing Parent Links

**Issue #[N]** currently has no parent link.

**Add to issue body**:
```markdown
## Traceability
- Traces to:  #[parent-StR-number]
```

### Suggested Dependencies

Based on content analysis, this requirement likely depends on:
- #[M]: [Title] - [Reason for dependency]

**Add to Traceability section**:
```markdown
- **Depends on**: #[M], #[P]
```

---

## 📏 Measurability Improvements (REQ-NF only)

### Current Problem
The NFR is not quantifiable: "[vague statement]"

### Add Metrics Table

**Replace vague statement with**:
```markdown
## Measurable Criteria

| Metric | Target | Measurement Method | Acceptance Threshold |
|--------|--------|-------------------|---------------------|
| [Metric Name] | [X units] | [How to measure] | [Pass/fail criteria] |
| Response Time | <200ms | 95th percentile under load | <500ms absolute max |
| Availability | 99.9% | Monthly uptime monitoring | >99.5% |

## Acceptance Criteria

**Measurement Period**: [e.g., "30 days post-deployment"]

**Pass Criteria**:
- ALL target values met during measurement period
- NO breaches of acceptance thresholds
- Automated monitoring confirms metrics

**Fail Criteria**:
- ANY metric exceeds acceptance threshold
- Metrics not measurable (instrumentation missing)
```

---

## 🎯 Acceptance Criteria Improvements

### Current Acceptance Criteria (Vague)
```markdown
[Existing vague criteria from issue]
```

### Improved Acceptance Criteria (Specific & Testable)
```markdown
## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario 1: [Specific Scenario Name]
**Given** [specific initial state with data]
**When** [specific user action with parameters]
**Then** [specific observable outcome with values]
  **And** [additional verifiable outcome]

**Examples**:
| Input | Expected Output | Notes |
|-------|----------------|-------|
| [Concrete example 1] | [Expected result 1] | [Context] |
| [Concrete example 2] | [Expected result 2] | [Context] |

### Scenario 2: [Edge Case Name]
**Given** [edge case setup]
**When** [boundary condition action]
**Then** [expected behavior]

### Scenario 3: [Error Case Name]
**Given** [error condition setup]
**When** [invalid action]
**Then** [error handling behavior]
  **And** [user sees: "[specific error message]"]
```

**Why Better**: 
- Concrete examples (not abstract)
- Testable with specific data
- Covers happy path, edge cases, and errors
- Verifiable pass/fail criteria

## 🔄 Refinement Workflow

1. **Identify Issue**: User requests refinement of issue #N or validation detects issues
2. **Analyze**: Review issue body, check against ISO 29148 standards
3. **Generate Suggestions**: Create specific, actionable edit recommendations
4. **Provide Templates**: Give copy-paste ready content for user
5. **Optional Decomposition**: Suggest breaking complex issues into sub-issues
6. **Verify**: After user edits, re-validate to confirm improvements

---

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Refine Ambiguous Requirement

**User Input**:
```
/requirements-refine.prompt.md Refine issue #15 (REQ-F-USER-001: Login).

The acceptance criteria are vague: "User can log in successfully."
```

**Output**:
```markdown
# Refinement Suggestions for #15

## 🔴 P0 Improvement: Vague Acceptance Criteria

**Problem**: "User can log in successfully" is not testable - no specific data or outcomes.

**Recommended Edit**:

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario 1: Valid Credentials
**Given** user "john@example.com" exists with password "SecurePass123!"
**When** user enters email "john@example.com" and password "SecurePass123!"
  **And** clicks "Login" button
**Then** user is redirected to dashboard at "/dashboard"
  **And** session token is set in cookie "session_id"
  **And** user sees welcome message "Welcome back, John!"

### Scenario 2: Invalid Password
**Given** user "john@example.com" exists
**When** user enters email "john@example.com" and password "WrongPassword"
**Then** login fails with error "Invalid email or password"
  **And** user remains on login page
  **And** password field is cleared

### Scenario 3: Rate Limiting
**Given** user has failed login 5 times in 5 minutes
**When** user attempts 6th login
**Then** login is blocked with error "Too many attempts. Try again in 15 minutes."
  **And** account is temporarily locked for 15 minutes
```

---

### Example 2: Decompose Complex Requirement

**User Input**:
```
/requirements-refine.prompt.md Analyze issue #20 (REQ-F-CHECKOUT-001: Complete checkout process).

This seems too large - should it be split?
```

**Output**:
```markdown
# Refinement: Decompose #20

**Analysis**: This issue covers 5 distinct functional areas: cart review, shipping selection, payment processing, order confirmation, and email notification. **Recommendation**: Split into 5 focused issues.

## Proposed Sub-Issue #1: REQ-F-CHECKOUT-010: Review Cart

**Issue Body**:
```markdown
## Requirement Statement
The system shall display the shopping cart contents for review during checkout.

## Inputs
| Input | Type | Example |
|-------|------|---------|
| session_id | UUID | "a1b2c3d4-..." |

## Outputs
| Output | Type | Example |
|--------|------|---------|
| cart_items | List<CartItem> | [{"product": "Laptop", "qty": 1, "price": 999.99}] |
| subtotal | Decimal | 999.99 |

## Acceptance Criteria
**Given** user has 2 items in cart
**When** user clicks "Checkout"
**Then** cart summary displays all items with quantities and prices
  **And** subtotal is correctly calculated

## Traceability
- Traces to:  #[parent-StR]
- **Part of**: #20 (checkout flow)
```

**Action**: Create 5 new issues, update #20 to reference them:
```markdown
## Decomposition
This checkout flow is implemented via:
- #21: Review Cart
- #22: Select Shipping
- #23: Process Payment
- #24: Confirm Order
- #25: Send Confirmation Email
```
```

---

### Example 3: Improve NFR Measurability

**User Input**:
```
/requirements-refine.prompt.md Improve issue #30 (REQ-NF-PERF-001: System performance).

Current requirement: "System shall be fast."
```

**Output**:
```markdown
# Refinement: #30 Measurability

## 🔴 P0 Critical: Non-Measurable Requirement

**Current**: "System shall be fast" ❌

**Improved**:

## Requirement Statement
The system shall provide low-latency responses for API endpoints under normal and peak load conditions.

## Measurable Criteria

| Metric | Target | Measurement Method | Acceptance Threshold |
|--------|--------|-------------------|---------------------|
| API Response Time (GET) | <100ms | 95th percentile, 1000 req/s | <200ms |
| API Response Time (POST) | <200ms | 95th percentile, 500 req/s | <400ms |
| Database Query Time | <50ms | 95th percentile, aggregated | <100ms |
| Page Load Time | <2s | 95th percentile, real user monitoring | <3s |

## Testing Strategy
- **Load Test**: Apache JMeter with 1000 concurrent users
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana dashboards
- **Duration**: 30 days post-deployment
- **Reporting**: Weekly performance reports to stakeholders

## Acceptance Criteria

**Pass Criteria**:
- ALL metrics meet target values for 95% of requests
- NO metrics exceed acceptance thresholds
- Monitoring dashboards show stable performance

**Fail Criteria**:
- ANY metric consistently exceeds acceptance threshold (>10% of time)
- Performance degrades over measurement period
- Monitoring not functional (cannot verify)
```
